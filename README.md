The back end uses Javascript for the API and axios to link it to the database in AWS Lambda. It's dependencies are: axios, body-parser, cors, express, mysql and serverless-http.

The front end app is made with JavaScript, React and Bootstrap.

## Features
### Back end
CRUD implimentation.

### Front end
The Big Day To Do List lets you add in a task. If it's urgent you can toggle it so. Urgent items are signaled with a simple '!' in the lists.

The to do list section lets you either mark the item as complete, or delete the item if it's no longer required.

When you delete a list item it is removed from the database.

When you mark as complete, the item will list in the completed list which is ordered from newest completed to oldest completed. When this list reaches 7 the oldest list items will be removed.
